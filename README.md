## Overview

69069 is a pure on-chain event ledger. It holds no assets, executes nothing on behalf of users, and has no admin, owner, or upgrade path. It only records signed data as permanent events.


## Core Mechanic

Every successful call writes one atomic record containing:

- the signer  
- the intended address  
- a payload hash  
- the raw signature  
- free-form metadata  

Writing a record increments two independent counters:

- `pushOf[signer]`  
- `trustOf[intendedTo]`  

A global counter, `phaseTotal`, also increments on every record.

The effective value for any address is defined as:

```
effective = trustOf − pushOf
```

This signed integer is exposed directly through `effectiveOf()` and `statsOf()`. For wallet-style display it is cast to a non-negative `uint256` via `balanceOf()`, which returns `max(0, effective)`.

All counters are cyclic `uint256` values. When a counter reaches `type(uint256).max` it wraps to zero and a separate, permanent overflow counter is incremented. An event is emitted on every wrap.

## Comparison to ERC-20 Tokens

From the outside, 69069 deliberately presents the familiar surface of an ERC-20 token:

- `name()` → `"69069"`  
- `symbol()` → `"SOS"`  
- `decimals()` → `0`  
- `balanceOf(address)` → non-negative Effective value  
- `totalSupply()` → total number of records ever written  
- `Transfer` events emitted on every record  

In a normal ERC-20, a Transfer moves tokens from one balance to another. In 69069 the same event is emitted, but the underlying meaning is different:

- The “from” address is the **signer** (Push).  
- The “to” address is the **intended** recipient (Trust).  
- The value is always 1.  

Consequently:

- When a signature is recorded with you as the intended address, your Effective rises by +1 (exactly as if you received 1 SOS).  
- When you are the signer, your Effective falls by −1 (exactly as if you sent 1 SOS).  

Wallets and explorers therefore display balances and transfer histories exactly as they would for any ordinary ERC-20. The user experience feels familiar. Internally, however, nothing is transferred, nothing can be spent, and no asset ever exists.

## Recording Functions

There are some ways to create a record.

**recordSignature**  
Accepts the same five fields but verifies the signature on-chain. It recovers the signing address from the signature and the payload hash using `ecrecover` and reverts unless the recovered address matches the declared signer exactly. The payload hash is used as-is, without any message prefix.

**recordSignatureOne**  
Accepts one signer, one intended address, and equal-length arrays of payload hashes, signatures, and metadata. Each entry is verified independently and written as its own record. A call with N entries increases both the signer’s Push and the intended address’s Trust by N, and emits one permanent event per entry. This is the only remaining batch-style function.

## Recording Path

All functions route through the same internal step, which:

1. Updates the Push and Trust counters (and the global phaseTotal).  
2. Emits a display-only `Transfer` event (signer → intendedTo, value = 1).  
3. Emits the permanent `SignatureRecorded` event containing the full packed unit: signer, intendedTo, payloadHash, signature, submitter, timestamp, and metadata.

## Signing and Submission

The signer only ever produces a signature off-chain. Any address can later submit that signature on-chain. The submitting address pays the gas and is recorded as the submitter. The signer and the submitter may be the same address or different ones.

## Wallet Display Surface

Because the contract exposes the standard ERC-20 view functions and emits Transfer events, ordinary wallets and block explorers treat 69069 as a normal token. Users see balances, transfer histories, and a familiar ticker. There is, however, no `transfer`, no `approve`, and no way to move anything. The familiar surface is purely presentational.

## HTML Bridge Layer

An HTML front-end can serve as a seamless bridge between the ordinary ERC-20 mental model and the ledger’s true behaviour.  

On the outside the page can present the classic actions users already understand:

- “Send 1 SOS to address X”  
- “Receive signatures intended for me”  
- Balance display that matches any wallet  

Under the hood the page constructs the correct payload, obtains an off-chain signature, and calls the appropriate record function (`recordSignature`, `recordSignatureOne`, etc.). The user therefore interacts exactly as they would with a normal ERC-20 token, while the contract itself remains a pure, non-transferable event ledger. The HTML layer absorbs the cognitive difference; the on-chain logic stays minimal and immutable.

## Safety Properties

- Rejects all direct ETH transfers.  
- Checks that both addresses are non-zero on every record.  
- Contains no self-destruct mechanism.  
- Contains no proxy.  
- Contains no privileged account of any kind.

69069 therefore gives users the familiar experience of an ERC-20 token while remaining, at its core, nothing more than an append-only, identityless record of presence.
